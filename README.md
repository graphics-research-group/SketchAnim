# SketchAnim: Real-time sketch animation transfer from videos

Animation of hand-drawn sketches is an adorable art. It allows the animator to generate animations with expressive freedom
and requires significant expertise. In this work, we introduce a novel sketch animation framework designed to address inherent
challenges, such as motion extraction, motion transfer, and occlusion. The framework takes an exemplar video input featuring a
moving object and utilizes a robust motion transfer technique to animate the input sketch. We show comparative evaluations that
demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing sketch animation techniques. Notably, our approach exhibits
a higher level of user accessibility in contrast to conventional sketch-based animation systems, positioning it as a promising
contributor to the field of sketch animation.
